# Welcome to my first real *MySQL* practicing task!

On the 8th work-alone week at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com) we got a task to practice [*MySQL*](https://www.mysql.com/)
and to get acquainted with such functions as [*JOIN*](http://www.w3resource.com/mysql/advance-query-in-mysql/mysql-joins.php),
[*DISTINCT*](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_distinct.asp),
[*GROUP BY*](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp),
[string-functions](http://www.w3resource.com/mysql/string-functions/mysql-ascii-function.php) etc.

[You can find detailed task-description here.](description.md)

[My conclusions and questions about solution can be found here.](conclusion.md)

My solution can be found in the root of the repository (on the same level as this README file.)

[Here you can find some notes.](notes.md)
This file has a big overlap with [conclusion file](conclusion.md),
but while [conclusion.md](conclusion.md) was created to summarize (and demonstrate) my solution after solving all the tasks I was able to solve,
[notes.md](notes.md) was being created paralelly during solving the tasks in order to make my work easier.
It provides a short explanation for the files in directory [*my_examples/*](my_examples/).

The directory [*sample/*](sample/) contains the accessories of [task-description](description.md), including the creational and data-dumper script-files.
The directory [*my_examples/*](my_examples/) contains script-files that ease some questions I've bumped into.
This questions are described in [*notes.md*](notes.md).

Thank you for visiting my repository! :)
